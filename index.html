<p>Walter L. Cohen High School opened in Fall 1949. Mr. Eli W. Sorrell was its first principal.[3] The school was once under the authority of New Orleans Public Schools, but in 2009â€“2010 it fell under the authority of the Recovery School District.[4] In 2011, Walter L. Cohen High School was still managed by the Recovery School District, but also became part of New Orleans College Prep, a charter school operator headquartered in New Orleans. The school was renamed Cohen College Prep High School.[5]</p>
